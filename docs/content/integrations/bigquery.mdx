# BigQuery + Dagster

Using Dagster's [software-defined assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) and BigQuery I/O manager, you can easily interact with BigQuery tables alongside other Dagster assets.

Managing your BigQuery tables with Dagster enables you to:

- Use Python to analyze your data stored in BigQuery without writing custom SQL queries to fetch the data
- Visualize the data dependencies between tables
- Selectively update the contents of your tables
- Integrate your Snowflake tables with other tools in your data stack
