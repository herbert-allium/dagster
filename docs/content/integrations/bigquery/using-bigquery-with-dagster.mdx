# Using Dagster with BigQuery

This tutorial focuses on how to store and load Dagster's [software-defined assets (SDAs)](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) in BigQuery.

By the end of the tutorial, you will:

- Configure a BigQuery I/O manager
- Create a table in BigQuery using a Dagster asset
- Make a BigQuery table available in Dagster
- Load BigQuery tables in downstream assets

This guide focuses on storing and loading Pandas DataFrames in BigQuery. Dagster also supports using PySpark DataFrames with BigQuery. The concepts from this guide apply to working with PySpark DataFrames, and you can learn more about setting up and using the BigQuery I/O manager with PySpark DataFrames in the [reference guide](/integrations/bigquery/reference).

---

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- **To install the `dagster-gcp` and `dagster-gcp-pandas` libraries**:

  ```shell
  pip install dagster-gcp dagster-gcp-pandas
  ```

- **To gather the following information**, which is required to use the BigQuery I/O manager:

  - **Google Cloud Project (GCP) project name**: You can find this by logging into GCP and choosing one of the project names listed in the dropdown in the top left corner:

  - **GCP credentials**: You can authenticate with GCP two ways: by following GCP authentication instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc), or by providing credentials directly to the BigQuery I/O manager. In this guide, we assume that you have run one of the `gcloud auth` commands or have set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` as specified in the linked instructions. For more information on providing credentials directly to the BigQuery I/O manager, see [Providing credentials as configuration](TODO LINK) in the BigQuery reference guide.

    The Snowflake I/O manager can read all of these authentication values from environment variables. In this guide, we use password authentication and store the username and password as `SNOWFLAKE_USER` and `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD`, respectively.

---

## Step 1: Configure the Snowflake I/O manager

The Snowflake I/O manager requires some configuration to connect to your Snowflake instance. The `account`, `user` are required to connect with Snowflake. One method of authentication is required. You can use a password or a private key. Additionally, you need to specify a `database` to where all the tables should be stored.

You can also provide some optional configuration to further customize the Snowflake I/O manager. You can specify a `warehouse` and `schema` where data should be stored, and a `role` for the I/O manager.

```python file=/integrations/snowflake/configuration.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
from dagster_snowflake_pandas import snowflake_pandas_io_manager

from dagster import Definitions

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[iris_dataset],
    resources={
        "io_manager": snowflake_pandas_io_manager.configured(
            {
                "account": "abc1234.us-east-1",  # required
                "user": {"env": "SNOWFLAKE_USER"},  # required
                "password": {
                    "env": "SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD"
                },  # password or private key required
                "database": "FLOWERS",  # required
                "role": "writer",  # optional, defaults to the default role for the account
                "warehouse": "PLANTS",  # optional, defaults to default warehouse for the account
                "schema": "IRIS,",  # optional, defaults to PUBLIC
            }
        )
    },
)
```

With this configuration, if you materialized an asset called `iris_dataset`, the Snowflake I/O manager would be permissioned with the role `writer` and would store the data in the `FLOWERS.IRIS.IRIS_DATASET` table in the `PLANTS` warehouse.

Finally, in the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object, we assign the <PyObject module="dagster_snowflake_pandas" object="snowflake_pandas_io_manager" /> to the `io_manager` key. `io_manager` is a reserved key to set the default I/O manager for your assets.

For more info about each of the configuration values, refer to the <PyObject module="dagster_snowflake_pandas" object="snowflake_pandas_io_manager" /> API documentation.

## Step 2: Create tables in Snowflake

The Snowflake I/O manager can create and update tables for your Dagster defined assets, but you can also make existing Snowflake tables available to Dagster.

<TabGroup>

<TabItem name="Create tables in Snowflake from Dagster assets">

### Store a Dagster asset as a table in Snowflake

To store data in Snowflake using the Snowflake I/O manager, the definitions of your assets don't need to change. You can tell Dagster to use the Snowflake I/O Manager, like in [Step 1: Configure the Snowflake I/O manager](#step-1-configure-the-snowflake-io-manager), and Dagster will handle storing and loading your assets in Snowflake.

```python file=/integrations/snowflake/basic_example.py
import pandas as pd

from dagster import asset


@asset
def iris_dataset() -> pd.DataFrame:
    return pd.read_csv(
        "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data",
        names=[
            "Sepal length (cm)",
            "Sepal width (cm)",
            "Petal length (cm)",
            "Petal width (cm)",
            "Species",
        ],
    )
```

In this example, we first define our [asset](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets). Here, we are fetching the Iris dataset as a Pandas DataFrame and renaming the columns. The type signature of the function tells the I/O manager what data type it is working with, so it is important to include the return type `pd.DataFrame`.

When Dagster materializes the `iris_dataset` asset using the configuration from [Step 1: Configure the Snowflake I/O manager](#step-1-configure-the-snowflake-io-manager), the Snowflake I/O manager will create the table `FLOWERS.IRIS.IRIS_DATASET` if it does not exist and replace the contents of the table with the value returned from the `iris_dataset` asset.

</TabItem>

<TabItem name="Make existing tables available in Dagster">

### Make an existing table available in Dagster

You may already have tables in Snowflake that you want to make available to other Dagster assets. You can create [source assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#defining-external-asset-dependencies) for these tables. By creating a source asset for the existing table, you tell Dagster how to find the table so it can be fetched for downstream assets.

```python file=/integrations/snowflake/source_asset.py
from dagster import SourceAsset

iris_harvest_data = SourceAsset(key="iris_harvest_data")
```

In this example, we create a <PyObject object="SourceAsset" /> for a pre-existing table - perhaps created by an external data ingestion tool - that contains data about iris harvests. To make the data available to other Dagster assets, we need to tell the Snowflake I/O manager how to find the data.

Since we supply the database and the schema in the I/O manager configuration in [Step 1: Configure the Snowflake I/O manager](#step-1-configure-the-snowflake-io-manager), we only need to provide the table name. We do this with the `key` parameter in `SourceAsset`. When the I/O manager needs to load the `iris_harvest_data` in a downstream asset, it will select the data in the `FLOWERS.IRIS.IRIS_HARVEST_DATA` table as a Pandas DataFrame and provide it to the downstream asset.

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

---

## Step 3: Load Snowflake tables in downstream assets

Once you have created an asset or source asset that represents a table in Snowflake, you will likely want to create additional assets that work with the data. Dagster and the Snowflake I/O manager allow you to load the data stored in Snowflake tables into downstream assets

```python file=/integrations/snowflake/load_downstream.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
import pandas as pd

from dagster import asset

# this example uses the iris_dataset asset from Step 2


@asset
def iris_cleaned(iris_dataset: pd.DataFrame):
    return iris_dataset.dropna().drop_duplicates()
```

In this example, we want to provide the `iris_dataset` asset from the [Store a Dagster asset as a table in Snowflake](#store-a-dagster-asset-as-a-table-in-snowflake) example to the `iris_cleaned` asset.

In `iris_cleaned`, the `iris_dataset` parameter tells Dagster that the value for the `iris_dataset` asset should be provided as input to `iris_cleaned`. If this feels too magical for you, refer to the [docs for explicitly specifying dependencies](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#defining-explicit-dependencies).

When materializing these assets, Dagster will use the `snowflake_pandas_io_manager` to fetch the `FLOWERS.IRIS.IRIS_DATASET` as a Pandas DataFrame and pass this DataFrame as the `iris_dataset` parameter to `iris_cleaned`. When `iris_cleaned` returns a Pandas DataFrame, Dagster will use the `snowflake_pandas_io_manager` to store the DataFrame as the `FLOWERS.IRIS.IRIS_CLEANED` table in Snowflake.

---

## Completed code example

When finished, your code should look like the following:

```python file=/integrations/snowflake/full_example.py
import pandas as pd
from dagster_snowflake_pandas import snowflake_pandas_io_manager

from dagster import Definitions, SourceAsset, asset

iris_harvest_data = SourceAsset(key="iris_harvest_data")


@asset
def iris_dataset() -> pd.DataFrame:
    return pd.read_csv(
        "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data",
        names=[
            "Sepal length (cm)",
            "Sepal width (cm)",
            "Petal length (cm)",
            "Petal width (cm)",
            "Species",
        ],
    )


@asset
def iris_cleaned(iris_dataset: pd.DataFrame):
    return iris_dataset.dropna().drop_duplicates()


defs = Definitions(
    assets=[iris_dataset, iris_harvest_data, iris_cleaned],
    resources={
        "io_manager": snowflake_pandas_io_manager.configured(
            {
                "account": "abc1234.us-east-1",
                "user": {"env": "SNOWFLAKE_USER"},
                "password": {"env": "SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD"},
                "database": "FLOWERS",
                "schema": "IRIS,",
            }
        )
    },
)
```
